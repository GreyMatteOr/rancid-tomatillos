# Rancid Tomatillos

A Web Development Project by [Matthew Lane](https://github.com/GreyMatteOr) and [Brigette Doelp](https://github.com/BrigetteDoelp)

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate fluency of the following Front-end design principles:

  - Integrated JS/CSS/HTML functionality
  - Efficient, Object-Oriented Information Hierarchy
  - Utilizing Asynchronous Execution to access information API's
  - Importing Modules, and using and using unfamiliar codebases
  - Showcase efficient REACT component usage
  - Architect a thorough TDD Suite to ensure functionality is maintained through the entire development process

The site itself is a Mock-up of a Movie rating Website. It hosts movie data, like user ratings and video's of the movie and allows users to rate and leave comments on movies.

In the future it will also host ratings, which can be voted on. The most popular reviews will be displayed immediately.

## Setup

```
git clone git@github.com:GreyMatteOr/rancid-tomatillos.git

Finally, in your browser, navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
